                            The research and development of modern Web applications, including search, recommendation, and advertisement, are highly complex and iterative processes that require a deep understanding of system dynamics and user behavior.
                            Simulations have proven useful in tackling various unresolved issues in both academia and industry, such as measuring the effect and potential bias of system interventions, forecasting long-term benefits such as equity, inclusivity, and diversity, and assessing intricate system characteristics under diverse human behaviors. Although simulations enable researchers and developers to craft controlled environments, there is a fragile equilibrium between manipulability and faithfulness, flexibility and complexity, hypothesis and actuality, which can raise doubts regarding the validity and practicality of simulation analysis.</p>
                        <p class="large text-muted">
                            Indeed, the efficacy of Web simulations is heavily reliant on the extent of analysis, the underlying assumptions, and the specific objectives and tasks at hand. Although simulations are widely employed by the community, there is a deficiency of comprehensive and structured tutorials that furnish instructions and guidelines for selecting appropriate tools in a given context.

                            Our tutorial has been proposed in a timely manner, with the objective of providing attendees with the essential background and scope, summarizing existing simulation concepts and frameworks, analyzing their main factors and limitations in real-world case studies, and linking Web simulations to advanced technologies such as causal inference, reinforcement learning, and Generative AI. We aim to present a comprehensive overview of the various factors that need to be considered, enabling attendees to navigate through the numerous intricate choices they may encounter while utilizing simulation technologies in practice. Drawing on the presenters' expertise and insights from other works, this lecture-style tutorial is intended to assist in designing, implementing, and optimizing simulation analysis for a variety of Web applications.
